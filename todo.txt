TODO!!

    - Refine the settings process
  - Make battle screen work

IDEA!!
Because the art is taking awhile, I should make it so I can import any image and
it will act as a "map" of sorts. I can Also create a character to explore the
map. I can use colors of the map to create barrier sprites easier. I should also
make a scrolling map so that larger "maps" can be explored.

Also, I could find a Discord bot that will notify the discord every time I make
a change to the repo, so that they will know that I am still working on it (and
possibly rush them along)
